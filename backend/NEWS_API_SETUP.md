# News API - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Resolution
The NewsAPI integration is now working correctly. The problem was in the news client configuration - it was trying to use both `q` (query) and `country` parameters with `get_top_headlines`, which NewsAPI doesn't allow.

## What Was Fixed
1. **News Client Configuration**: Changed from `get_top_headlines` to `get_everything` for keyword searches
2. **Data Formatting**: Fixed Article object to dictionary conversion
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for different failure scenarios

## Current Status
✅ **Real News Data**: Fetching live articles from NewsAPI
✅ **Sentiment Analysis**: AI analysis of news articles working
✅ **Multiple Keywords**: Support for various search terms
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks and error messages

## Test Results
- Regular news: 20 articles per search
- Sentiment analysis: 5 articles analyzed per search
- Real news sources: Biztoc.com, CNN, etc.
- Live data: Articles from the last 24-48 hours

The AI Trading Analysis page now has fully functional news integration with real-time data and sentiment analysis.
