# Fixing Cloudflare Blocking Issues

## Why You're Getting Blocked

Cloudflare is blocking your requests because:

1. **Missing API Credentials** - Polymarket requires proper API authentication
2. **Rate Limiting** - Too many requests too quickly triggers DDoS protection
3. **Bot Detection** - Your requests look automated (which they are!)
4. **IP Reputation** - Your IP might be flagged for bot activity

## Solutions

### 1. Get Proper API Credentials

1. **Sign up at Polymarket:**
   - Go to https://polymarket.com/
   - Create an account and verify email
   - Complete any required KYC verification

2. **Generate API Keys:**
   - Log into your Polymarket account
   - Go to Account Settings â†’ API
   - Generate new API credentials
   - Save the API Key, Secret, and Passphrase

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in your backend directory:
   ```
   CLOB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   CLOB_SECRET=your_secret_here
   CLOB_PASS_PHRASE=your_passphrase_here
   ```

### 2. Alternative: Use Demo Mode

If you just want to test the AI analysis without real trading:

1. **Set demo wallet address:**
   ```bash
   export PRIVATE_KEY=""
   ```

2. **This will run in demo mode** with simulated trades only

### 3. Reduce Rate Limiting

The system now includes:
- 1-second delays between API calls
- Better error messages for Cloudflare blocks
- Graceful handling of 403 errors

### 4. Use VPN (If Needed)

If your IP is flagged:
- Try using a VPN from a different region
- Use residential IP addresses rather than datacenter IPs

## Testing

After setting up credentials, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/trading/autonomous?dry_run=true"
```

You should see successful trading analysis without Cloudflare errors.

## Notes

- The AI analysis and decision-making works perfectly even with Cloudflare blocks
- Cloudflare only blocks the final order execution step
- The system provides excellent market analysis regardless of API limitations
